# Year-Section Based Performance Analysis Update

## Overview
Updated the Performance Analyzer to show year-based distribution instead of grade distribution and added comprehensive search capabilities for both overall class and individual student performance.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Updates

#### Year Distribution (Instead of Grade Distribution)
- **Before**: Showed A Grade, B Grade, C Grade, etc.
- **After**: Shows 1st Year, 2nd Year, 3rd Year, 4th Year student counts
- Added "View" buttons for each year to filter students
- Color-coded year badges for easy identification

#### Performance Search Section
- **Overall Class Performance**: 
  - Filter by year (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
  - Filter by section (CSE A, CSE B, CSM, ECE, COS)
  - View class performance button
- **Individual Student Performance**:
  - Search by student name or roll number
  - Direct navigation to student profiles

### 2. Backend API Updates

#### Analytics API (`analytics.py`)
- Added `year_distribution` calculation based on subject year data
- Maps year numbers (1,2,3,4) to year labels (1st Year, 2nd Year, etc.)
- Maintains backward compatibility with grade distribution

#### Students API (`students.py`)
- Added year and section filtering parameters
- Enhanced student search with `year` and `section` filters
- Returns year and section information for each student
- Improved query performance with proper joins

### 3. Frontend Updates

#### DashboardPage (`DashboardPage.js`)
- Replaced grade distribution with year distribution chart
- Added performance search section with two main options:
  - Overall class performance with year/section filters
  - Individual student search with real-time search
- Updated navigation to pass filter parameters

#### StudentsPage (`StudentsPage.js`)
- Added year and section filter dropdowns
- Enhanced student cards to show year and section badges
- Updated fetch function to handle multiple filter parameters
- Improved URL parameter handling for deep linking

#### Styling Updates
- Added year badge colors (blue, green, yellow, pink for years 1-4)
- Added section badge colors for different departments
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Enhanced filter section layout

### 4. Data Flow

#### Year Distribution Calculation
```
Database â†’ Subjects with year/section â†’ Count unique students â†’ Year distribution
```

#### Student Filtering
```
Search Parameters â†’ API Filters â†’ Database Query â†’ Filtered Results
```

#### Performance Search
```
Dashboard Search â†’ Students Page with Filters â†’ Individual Student Profile
```

## Usage Examples

### Teacher Workflow
1. **View Overall Performance**: 
   - Go to Dashboard â†’ Performance Search â†’ Select "2nd Year" and "CSE A" â†’ View Class Performance
   
2. **Find Specific Student**:
   - Go to Dashboard â†’ Performance Search â†’ Type student name â†’ Search Student
   
3. **Filter by Year**:
   - Go to Students Page â†’ Select "3rd Year" filter â†’ View all 3rd year students

### Data Organization
- **Year Distribution**: Shows how many students in each year
- **Section Filtering**: Filter students by their department/section
- **Combined Filters**: Year + Section + Search for precise results
